**Purpose:** Complete guide for testing AI-powered documentation generation from game descriptions

---

## üéØ **Overview**

Unity Project Architect includes powerful AI integration that can help you generate comprehensive project documentation from simple game descriptions. This guide will walk you through testing and using these AI features.

## üöÄ **Quick Start - Testing AI with Game Descriptions**

### **Method 1: Using the AI Test Window (Recommended)**

1. **Open the AI Test Window**
   - In Unity, go to `Tools > Unity Project Architect > AI Test Window`
   - This opens a dedicated interface for testing AI functionality

2. **Describe Your Game**
   - Use the provided example or write your own game description
   - Include details like:
     - Game genre and setting
     - Core gameplay mechanics  
     - Key features and systems
     - Target audience
     - Art style and platform

3. **Configure AI (Optional)**
   - Add your Claude API key for enhanced AI generation
   - Test the AI connection
   - If no API key is provided, the system uses intelligent fallback generators

4. **Generate Documentation**
   - Click "‚ú® Generate Documentation with AI"
   - Watch as the system creates:
     - **General Product Description** - Overview and key features
     - **User Stories** - Complete with epics, features, and acceptance criteria
     - **Work Tickets** - Implementation tasks, bug fixes, and technical debt
     - **System Architecture** - Technical structure and patterns

### **Method 2: Using the Main Window**

1. **Open the Main Window**
   - Go to `Tools > Unity Project Architect > Main Window`

2. **Create a Project Data Asset**
   - Click "Create New Project Data Asset"
   - Fill in your game name and description

3. **Enable AI Mode for Sections**
   - Select each documentation section you want to generate
   - Set `AIMode` to `FullGeneration` in the inspector

4. **Generate Individual Sections**
   - Click "Generate" next to each section
   - The system automatically uses AI when configured, falls back to template generators otherwise

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **"AI Connection Failed"**
- **Solution:** The system will use fallback generators - this is normal and still produces high-quality results
- **Alternative:** Add Claude API key for enhanced AI features

### **"Empty/Generic Content"**
- **Solution:** Provide more detailed game description with specific features and mechanics
- **Tip:** Include target audience, platform, and unique selling points

### **"Slow Generation"**
- **Cause:** AI processing can take 30-60 seconds per section
- **Solution:** Be patient - quality content takes time to generate

### **"Documentation Doesn't Match Game"**
- **Solution:** Review and refine your game description to be more specific
- **Tip:** Use clear section headers and bullet points in your description
