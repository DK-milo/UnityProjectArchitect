# Unity Project Architect

**Version:** 0.1.0 (MVP Development)  
**Unity Compatibility:** Unity 6 (6000.0.0f1+) and Unity 2023.3+  
**Status:** Stage 1 - Technical Documentation Phase  

An AI-powered project management and documentation tool for Unity developers that automatically generates comprehensive project documentation, creates templates, and provides intelligent development workflow assistance.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Unity Project Architect is a Unity Editor package designed to:
- **Generate complete project documentation** (6 standard sections) automatically
- **Create project templates and structures** for different Unity project types
- **Integrate AI assistance** (Claude API) for planning and content generation
- **Manage development workflows** within Unity Editor using UI Toolkit

## 📋 Current Status - Stage 1 Complete ✅

**Completed Tasks:**
- [x] Unity package structure setup with proper directories
- [x] Package.json configuration with Unity metadata
- [x] Assembly Definition files for Runtime/Editor separation
- [x] Comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- [x] Coding conventions and Unity package guidelines

**Package Structure Created:**

## 📚 Documentation Completed

### 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Location: `Documentation~/ProductRequirementsDocument.md`

**Key Sections:**
- Executive Summary & Product Vision
- Target Users & Use Cases (Solo Developer, Team Lead, Freelance Developer)
- Functional Requirements (Documentation Generator, Template System, AI Integration)
- Technical Requirements (Unity 6 compatibility, performance specs)
- User Experience Requirements & Workflows
- Package API Design & Extension Points
- Development Roadmap (30-hour MVP timeline)

### 2. Coding Conventions & Guidelines
Location: `Documentation~/CodingConventions.md`

**Key Standards:**
- Unity package development best practices
- C# coding standards with Unity-specific patterns
- UI Toolkit implementation conventions
- API design principles for clean interfaces
- Error handling and logging standards
- Testing conventions for Unity packages
- Performance guidelines and async patterns

## 🔧 Technical Foundation

### Assembly Definitions
- **Runtime Assembly** (`UnityProjectArchitect.Runtime`)
  - Core functionality accessible to end users
  - Dependencies: Unity.UI (UI Toolkit)
  - Auto-referenced for easy consumption

- **Editor Assembly** (`UnityProjectArchitect.Editor`)  
  - Editor-only functionality
  - References Runtime assembly
  - Platform-restricted to Editor

- **Test Assemblies** (Runtime & Editor)
  - Separate test assemblies with proper test runner setup
  - Uses `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` define constraint

### Package Metadata
- **Package Name:** `com.unitprojectarchitect.core`
- **Unity Version:** 2023.3+ (developed for Unity 6)
- **Dependencies:** Unity UI Toolkit only
- **Keywords:** documentation, project-management, ai, templates, productivity

## 🚀 Next Steps - Stage 2: Functional Code (18 hours)

**Sprint 2.1: Core Framework (6h)**
- Implement core data models (ProjectData, DocumentationSettings)
- Create template system foundation
- Set up basic service interfaces

**Sprint 2.2: Documentation Generator (6h)**  
- Build project analysis engine
- Implement 6 documentation section generators
- Create export system (Markdown, PDF)

**Sprint 2.3: AI Integration (6h)**
- Integrate Claude API with secure key management
- Develop specialized prompts for each documentation section
- Build AI assistant interface

## 🎯 Success Criteria for MVP

- [ ] Package installs cleanly in any Unity 6 project
- [ ] All 6 documentation sections generate automatically
- [ ] Claude API integration works with user-provided keys  
- [ ] Template system creates functional project structures
- [ ] Editor UI follows Unity conventions and is intuitive
- [ ] Complete test coverage (80%+)
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (<2s startup, <30s generation)

## 🛡️ Quality Standards

- **Unity Compatibility:** Maintains compatibility with Unity 2023.3+
- **Zero External Dependencies:** Works without additional package installations
- **Secure API Key Management:** Uses Unity's EditorPrefs encryption
- **Offline Mode:** Core functionality works without internet
- **Professional Documentation:** Comprehensive user and developer docs

## 📖 Development Guidelines

All development follows the established conventions in `Documentation~/CodingConventions.md`:
- Unity package development best practices
- Clean C# code with proper namespacing (`UnityProjectArchitect.*`)
- UI Toolkit for all editor interfaces
- Comprehensive unit testing with NUnit
- Async/await patterns for long-running operations
- Proper error handling and logging
